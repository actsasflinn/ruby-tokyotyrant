= TokyoTyrant Ruby Client

This is an _EXPERIMENTAL_ c extension for Ruby to access TokyoTyrant databases.  It currently supports key/value and table databases.

== Performance

This is not in production but the initial benchmarks are very interesting. Results look closer to the memcached gem than any other tyrant client I've seen for Ruby.

* Table Store: http://gist.github.com/74116

== TODO

* Make API more Ruby-like
  * Improve Query API (accept a symbols in place of constants)
  * Enumerable(-like) methods
* Specs!!!!
