= TokyoTyrant Ruby Client

This is an _EXPERIMENTAL_ c extension for Ruby to access TokyoTyrant databases.  It currently supports key/value and table databases.

== Performance

This is not in production use but the initial benchmarks are very interesting. Rsults look as closer to the memcached gem than any other tyrant client I've seen for Ruby.
