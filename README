= TokyoTyrant Ruby Client

This is an _EXPERIMENTAL_ c extension for Ruby to access TokyoTyrant databases.  It currently supports key/value and table databases.

== Performance

This is not in production but the initial benchmarks are very interesting. Results look closer to the memcached gem than any other tyrant client I've seen for Ruby.

* Table Store: http://gist.github.com/74116

== TODO

* enumerable methods for table db
* implement mget/mput through misc
* implement get_reverse for has_value?
* fix up and test extensions
* Specs!!!!
